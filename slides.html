                        This is a project I undertook during my 4th semester in college to help in finding an internship for the summer of 2018.
                        Following the advice of my guidance counselor, I decided that I would need to make an ePortfolio to have the best chances
                        of finding an internship. However, I decided to take things a step further by making my own website from scratch instead
                        of using a content management system such as wordpress or a site building service like squarespace. Moreover, having a good
                        understanding of the popular web libraries and frameworks (bootstrap, react, angularjs, etc) I figured I'd make this project
                        an even better and more fun learning opportunity by using only my own code.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By building this site, I was able to brush up on the basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript
                        skills that I learned in school. I also learned how to animate pages with CSS, how to use AJAX for http requests. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also hope to make this project something I can keep working on in the future. For instance, I plan to learn the GitHub API
                        and use it to automatically update and add project slides as I add more projects to my GitHub.

                    <h1>Multi-threaded Rush-Hour solver</h1>
                    <h2>An introduction to data-structures and multi-threading in Java</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            This is a project I completed for my Object-Oriented programming II course in my 3rd semester in college.
                            The goal was to create a javafx application that allowed the user to play the rush hour board game and to then
                            create an algorithm capable of solving the board on-demand in the least moves possible, then display the solution.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To accomplish, I first created a single-threaded breadth-first search that would run through the tree of all possible
                            configurations of the board, calculating possibilities level by level until finding a solution. It would then show the
                            player the step-by-step solution.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Having completed the project, I completed a multi-threaded version of this solution algorithm and found out that it was
                            actually less efficient than using a single-thread. Nonetheless, it allowed me to learn more about multi-threading and
                            concurrency.
