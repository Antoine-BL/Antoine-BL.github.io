        <p>
          The first step to solving a problem is to understand it. That's why I always strive to learn more about how software works. By
          understanding the inner workings of the tools I use, I am able to improve my proficiency with them and write better, more efficient code.
          Such knowledge not only allows that increase in efficiency, but it also gives a deeper appreciation for the technologies we use every day.
        </p>
        <p>
          This search for a better understanding of what surrounds me is what drove to become a software developer. It's what inspires me to
          create software to solve problems myself and others face. It's what motivates me to strive to improve myself and to make my projects
          better.
        </p>
        <p>
          This motivation and inspired design is what I hope to bring to your company.
